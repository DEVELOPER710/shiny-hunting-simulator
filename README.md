## 🎮 How It Works

1. Select a Pokémon species  
2. Choose how many encounters to roll at once  
3. Click **Start / Encounter**

When a shiny is found:
- It’s logged permanently
- Encounters since last shiny reset
- Lifetime encounters keep increasing

Refreshing the page will **NOT** reset your progress.
